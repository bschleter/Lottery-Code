# Powerball Lottery-Code

I did all this work and code and realized I have to subscribe to the API within the code-RapidAPI
You can login and create an account but also must subscribe to the API, be aware. 

I pushed this to git because it was an hour or so of prelimanary work before using torch, maybe someone can use it. 
In theory theres another API out there, could not find


## Simply Clone the repo ##


```git clone www.github.com/bschleter/lottery-code'''


### Begin by creating a .env file ### 
Do it in the format as the .env example.


```YOUR_API_KEY=```

#### Run the starting file and every other file as you choose to do basic analysis ###


```python getdata.py```

Enjoy.
